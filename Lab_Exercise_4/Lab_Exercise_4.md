I. OBJECTIVES:  

In this laboratory exercise, the students are expected to:  
- Find the frequency response of a given system in differential equation form

II. MATERIALS:  

- Software: MATLA

III. PROCEDURES:  

THEORY:  
Systems respond differently to inputs of different frequencies. Some systems amplify components of certain frequencies and attenuate others. The relationship between the system output and input across different frequencies is called the frequency response of the system.

Amplitude Response: For each frequency, the magnitude indicates how much the system amplifies or attenuates the input signal.

Phase Response: The phase indicates how the system shifts the phase of input sinusoids.

The phase response, or its derivative (group delay), shows how the system delays the input signal depending on the frequency.

RESULT:  
VIVA QUESTIONS:

1. Define frequency response  

- Frequency response describes how a system reacts to different input signal frequencies by altering their amplitude and phase. It helps in understanding the system's behavior in the frequency domain.  

2. Define magnitude response  

- Magnitude response explains the extent to which a system amplifies or attenuates an input signal at specific frequencies.  

3. Define phase response  

- Phase response shows how a system changes the phase of input signals across various frequencies, indicating any time shifts introduced by the system.  

4. Define transfer function  

- A transfer function is a mathematical representation that defines the input-output relationship of a system in the frequency domain. It is often written as the ratio of output to input in the Laplace or z-domain.  

5. State the significance of difference equations  

- Difference equations are fundamental in digital signal processing as they represent the relationship between the input and output of discrete-time systems. They are used in designing and analyzing such systems.  

6. What are the classifications of systems based on unit sample response  

- Causal systems: Depend only on current and past inputs  
- Stable systems: Ensure bounded output for bounded input  
- Linear systems: Obey superposition and proportionality  
- Time-invariant systems: Maintain consistent behavior over time  

7. What is zero input response  

- Zero input response is the output generated by a system solely due to its initial conditions, without any external input applied.  

8. Define impulse response  

- Impulse response is the system's output when an input is a unit impulse. It provides a complete description of the system's characteristics in the time domain.  

9. Define system  

- A system is a process or entity that transforms input signals into output signals according to a defined set of rules or operations.  

10. Write the mathematical formula to find the response of any given system  

- The response of a system can be expressed as:  
  y[n] = Î£ h[k] * x[n-k],  
  where h[k] is the impulse response, x[n] is the input, and y[n] is the output.
